		"years old and I focus on software development for web, mobile, and other platforms. I have nearly 20 years of professional experience building applications and modern backend systems with a strong focus on security, scalability, and performance. I wrote my first website back in 1998 while still at school. Ten years later (2008) I officially started my business. I spent several years working as a freelancer and also experienced full-time roles for international startups, mid-size companies, and large multinational corporations. You can learn more about my professional career in my",
		"I am currently actively looking for new opportunities — either full-time employment or a long-term project (B2B). In my last role, I worked on multiple short-term projects within custom development; now I would prefer to focus on a single main product, develop it long-term, and collaborate with a clear direction and roadmap. Samples of my work can be found on",
		"Among other things, I am passionate about artificial intelligence (AI) and LLM chatbots, security, and accessibility. I test source code to achieve the highest possible quality, usability, and performance in the shortest reasonable time. I regularly use unit tests, end-to-end tests, performance tests, penetration tests, and integration tests, including automated ones (pipelines). I work closely with teams, am used to daily code reviews, sharing results, consulting with colleagues, implementing changes, and refactoring. Some of my favorite modern testing tools include Playwright and Jest.",
		"I most often work with JavaScript/TypeScript (Angular, React). In Node.js, my preferred framework is NestJS, as well as modern AdonisJS. In Python, I most frequently use FastAPI, but I also have historical experience with projects written in Django. Additionally, I have built a significant number of applications in Java, mainly in corporate environments using Spring Boot and Hibernate ORM, elementary with with C#/.NET.",
		"In my free time, I spending time with my children, meeting friends, culture, sports, and outdoor activities (cycling, skiing, horseback riding, rafting in summer), as well as developing browser extensions (e.g. Add To Reading List) and chatbots for community portals."
